 About the Experimental Study Group
-----------------------------------

[The Experimental Study Group](http://esg.mit.edu/) (ESG) is one of four freshmen learning communities at MIT. It provides students with the opportunity to take their required courses in small seminar-style classes, instead of in large lecture halls. In addition to offering a comprehensive academic program for freshmen, ESG also provides a place where students and staff can study and socialize together. Each year, about 50 freshmen, 15 sophomores, 10 staff members, and 20 upper class instructors (who have been in ESG as freshmen) participate in the program. Staff members are drawn from MIT's Departments of Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Activities such as weekly luncheons and weekend trips facilitate interaction among community members.
