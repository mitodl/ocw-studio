_{{< anchor "1" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Melanzane alla Parmigiana_/Eggplant Parmesan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a light version.  In the classic recipe, the eggplant is deep friend (alone or dipped in egg and covered with bread crumbs.)

### Ingredienti per 4-6 persone

*   _Two large melanzane_/eggplants
*   _One spicchio d'aglio_/ garlic clove
*   _One L di passata di pomodoro_/plain strain tomatoes, we used 1.5 box of Pomì
*   _Parmigiano grattuggiato_ (grated, about 100 g, but decide by eye and taste)
*   _Mozzarella grattuggiato_ (grated) or a fette (in slices), about 1 cup
*   _Basilico fresco_ /resh basil, a few leaves
*   _sale_/salt
*   _zucchero_/sugar
*   Spices of your choice (e.g. red crushed pepper, nutmeg)

### Procedimento/Directions

1.  Wash the eggplants and cut them; max one centimeter thick.
2.  Let the the eggplant slices sit in a colander covered with abundant coarse salt. You can make many layers of eggplant and salt: this procedure removes the bitterness from the _melanzane_.
3.  After 30 minutes, drain, rinse very well, and pat dry with a paper towel.
4.  Grill the eggplant slices at 400 degrees F for about 10 minutes (or more, based on the thickness). Alternatively, grill them in a nonstick pan without oil on the stove or on the bbq.
5.  In the meantime, prepare a tomato sauce with a _soffritto_ of garlic.
6.  Cover the bottom of a baking dish with the tomato sauce.
7.  Place a layer of eggplant over the sauce.
8.  Sprinkle with grated mozzarella, grated parmesan, and basil leaves (as a whole or minced, as you wish)
9.  Repeat to make 3-4 layers ending with sauce
10.  Top with the remaining _mozzarella_ and _parmigiano_
11.  Bake at 400 degrees F for about 30 minutes.

_Le melanzane alla parmigiana_ is delicious eaten immediately and the day after is even _meglio/_better.  _Prova/_Try!

_{{< anchor "3" >}}{{< /anchor >}}La Bruschetta/Le Bruschette_
--------------------------------------------------------------

Pronunciation: Remember: _che_ in Italian reads _keh_ in English. Pronounce _brus-keh-te_.

Listen to the pronunciation:

[Bruschetta (MP3)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/bruschetta)

### Ingredienti

*   One baguette, or better some pugliese or toscano bread (one large crusty loaf)
*   Two _pomodori_/tomatoes or a large handful of _pomodorini_/cherry tomatoes
*   One _spicchio d'aglio_/garlic clove
*   _Basilico fresco_/fresh basil, a few leaves
*   _Sale_/Salt
*   _Olio extravergine d'oliva_/extra virgin olive oil

### Procedimento/Directions

1.  Chop the tomatoes and mix in a bowl with salt, olive oil and basil (You can use the whole leaves or mince them, as you prefer).
2.  Cut the bread in disks and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes (400 degrees F). During the summer you can grill the bread on the bbq.
3.  Option 1: rub the garlic on the toasted bread
4.  Option 2: add the garlic (as a whole or minced) to the tomato mix. Leave in the fridge for at least a few hours.
5.  You can either put the chopped tomatoes on the bread yourself, or for a big group, you can serve the bowl on one side, the bread on another, and let everyone help themselves.

 Buon appetito!

{{< anchor "2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}_Spezzatino in Bianco_/Beef Stew
-----------------------------------------------------------------

_Spezzatino_ means "little broken thing" = stew. _In bianco_ refers to the fact that we are not using tomatoes. This is my mom's recipe! If you serve it with _polenta_, then I suggest to make it without potatoes.

### Ingredienti per 4 persone

*   One kg (about 2.2 lb) of _manzo/_beef  for stew
*   1/2 _cipolla_/onion
*   One _spicchio d'aglio_ /garlic clove
*   One _carota_/carrot
*   One stalk of _sedano/_celery
*   Two _patate_/potatoes
*   One twig of _rosmarino_/rosemary
*   A couple of leaves of _alloro_/bay leaves
*   One _dado_/bouillon cube
*   _Olio d’oliva_
*   _Sale_
*   Optional: Two _pomodori/_tomatoes/ or _passata di pomodoro_ (e.g. Pomì)

### Precedimento

1.  Chop the carrot, onion, celery and garlic.
2.  Put in a pressure cooker with a little olive oil over low flame to make a sweat (soffritto). Then add the meat and the bouillon cube.
3.  When the meat outside is brown (extra step: in a few years, add a glass of wine and let it evaporate) cover with water and add the \[whole\] rosemary twig, bay leaves, and if you want other spices.
4.  Close the pressure cooker and pressurize (i.e. until the pressure cooker begins to whistle), cook for about 10-15 minutes.
5.  Depressurize, add the potatoes (washed and cut in big chunks) and cook again under pressure for another 10-15 minutes.
6.  If you use a regular pot or a slow cooker, cook at low heat for 2-3 hours, covered, mixing from time to time. While it cooks you can do your Physics homework ;)
7.  If most of the water has evaporated, simply add water (you can make the stew more or less thick based on your taste).
8.  When it is ready (be sure that both meat and potatoes are cooked and so soft that you can cut them with a fork) add salt if needed.
9.  You can make the sauce more creamy by mixing a spoon of sifted flour.

Buon appetito!
