_{{< anchor "1" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Patate e Finocchi al Latte_/Potatoes and Fennel in Milk
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ingredienti (For One Baking Pan)

*   4–5 large _patate_ (e.g. Idaho or Russet are perfect) and/or 2 _finocchi_/fennel bulbs
*   _latte_/milk
*   grated _parmigiano_
*   _olio d'oliva_/olive oil
*   _sale, pepe nero, noce moscata_/salt, black pepper, nutmeg

### Procedimento

1.  Preheat the oven at 200 degrees C/400 degrees F.
2.  Peel the potatoes and cut them in disks about 1/2 cm thick (1/5 inch).
3.  Wash the fennel bulbs, remove the stalks/leafy part and slice them (there isn't an ideal thickness, but if you make them thinner, they cook faster).
4.  Lightly coat the bottom of a porcelain or pyrex baking pan with olive oil.
5.  Make a few layers of potatoes/fennel and cheese, seasoning with a little salt, nutmeg, and black pepper.
6.  Add enough milk to cover.
7.  Top with grated _parmigiano._
8.  Bake until the milk becomes creamy, the _patate/finocchi_ are soft and the top is golden brown (based on the thickness, it usually takes 20–30 minutes).

### Variazioni

1.  You can add sliced onions and some garlic if you like them.
2.  Non-vegetarians can add a couple of thin layers of ham.
3.  If you want to reduce the time in the _forno_/oven, you can boil the potates/fennel before placing them in the baking pan. But you will have one extra _pentola_/pot to wash =P, so I do not consider it a time saver after all.
4.  You can add different spices, such as curry (not much used in Italy, but tasty).
5.  You can use also the stems of the _finocchi_ if you slice them very thin.
6.  _Finocchi_ are delicious raw, as a healthy snack, or in a salad.

_{{< anchor "2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Involtini di Pollo al Latte_/Chicken Roll-Ups
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ingredienti Per 2 Persone

*   500 g (about 1.1 lb) of chicken/_pollo_ breast/_petto→petto di pollo_ thinly sliced
*   2-3 thin slices of _prosciutto cotto_/ham
*   _Fontina_ or _Scamorza_ or another tasty cheese
*   About 10 fresh sage/_salvia_ leaves/_foglie→foglie di salvia_)
*   _latte_/milk
*   _olio d'oliva_
*   _sale_
*   _noce moscata_

### Procedimento

1.  Preheat the oven at 200 degrees C/400 degrees F.
2.  Out of 500 g of _petto di pollo_ you should get about 16 thin slices (you can also buy the chicken breast pre-sliced).
3.  Pound the chicken slices to tenderize them.
4.  Layer each cutlet with a small piece of ham, half a leaf of sage, a small piece of cheese and a few grains of salt.
5.  Roll up tightly and seal with a toothpick.
6.  Lightly coat the bottom of a porcelain or pyrex baking pan with olive oil and place the chicken rolls/_involtini di pollo_ side by side.
7.  Let them bake for about 10 minutes, flipping them until some parts get brown.
8.  Then cover with milk, season with salt and ground nutmeg and bake for another 20 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and the milk is creamy.

As an alternative, you can cook the _involtini_ in a non-stick pan or skillet initially at medium-high, then at medium heat. When you will be over 21, between steps 6 and 7 you can add a glass of wine and let the alcohol evaporate.
