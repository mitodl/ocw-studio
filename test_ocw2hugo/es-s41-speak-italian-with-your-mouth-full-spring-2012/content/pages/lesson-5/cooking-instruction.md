*   il po-mo-do-ri-no
*   l'a-ce-to bal-sa-mi-co

### Ingredienti Per 2 Persone

*   200 g  _di_ _carne macinata_ (ground meat; we used a mix of beef and sausages with the skin removed)
*   1-2 _cipolle_/onions
*   _aglio_/garlic (as much or as little as you like)
*   _olio d’oliva_/olive oil
*   _parmigiano grattugiato_/grated parmesan cheese
*   _prezzemolo_/italian parsley (1 bunch)
*   _sale_
*   _spezie_/spices (include _noce moscata_/nutmeg)

Optional:

*   _pan grattato_/bread crumbs)
*   One _uovo_/egg
*   _passata di pomodoro_/strained tomatoes
*   _zucchero_/sugar

### Preparazione_/_Directions

You can cook the meatballs in three different ways: deep fried, sautéed or in tomato sauce.

This recipe is for the last two options. If you want to fry them, follow the same steps (2→5) then deep fry them and drain the oil on paper towels.

1.  In a large pan prepare a _soffritto_/sweat with chopped garlic and onions. If you plan to use tomato sauce you can make the sweat with very little oil; otherwise you can use a couple of spoonfuls of olive oil and more onions or other veggies (e.g. carrots, celery).
2.  In the meantime, mince the rest of the onions and the parsley.
3.  Combine the ground meat, minced onions, parsley, a pinch of salt, and your favorite spices.
4.  Optional (more heavy): add some bread crumbs and one egg.
5.  Make small meatballs: if they are smaller they cook faster. I like them the size of a walnut.
6.  Add the meatballs to the sweat, increase the heat and saute until brown on all sides, and all the water they release evaporates.
7.  (over 21: add a glass of red wine and simmer until the alcohol is evaporated)
8.  _Le polpette sono pronte!_/ The meatballs are are ready!
9.  If you like them in tomato sauce, take a box of plain strained tomatoes (e.g. Pomì) and mix with the meatballs. Add salt and a little of sugar. Let simmer for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is thick.

In the U.S. meatballs are usually served on top of pasta. We typically serve meatballs as a second course, with some veggies as a side.

In class we made a salad with _lattuga/insalata romana_/romaine lettuce, _pomodorini_/cherry tomatoes and the basic italian _condimento/_dressing: salt, extra virgin olive oil, and vinegar or a little lemon juice.

_Polpette Di Zucchine_/Zucchini Balls
-------------------------------------

### Ingredienti Per 2 Persone

*   Two zucchini
*   One _spicchio di aglio_/garlic clove
*   One _uovo_/egg
*   _Pan grattato/Pangrattato_ (_Pan_ for _pane_\=bread, _grattato_\=grated→bread crumbs)
*   50 g _pecorino romano_ _grattuggiato_ (grated). You can also use parmesan instead, or another hard cheese
*   One bunch of _erba cipollina_/chives. Good alternatives: mint or parsley
*   _spezie_/spices e.g. a tiny bit of nutmeg and/or cardamom, curry (not used much in the Italian kitchen)
*   _olio d’oliva_/olive oil
*   _sale_ (salt)

### Preparazione/Directions

1.  Make a _soffritto_/sweatwith garlic (minced, or in disks, or as a whole, based on your taste).
2.  In the meantime wash and grate the zucchini.
3.  When the garlic is a little translucent, add the grated zucchini and cook at high heat, add salt and spices.
4.  When most of the water from the zucchini is evaporated, remove from heat and let cool.
5.  Pre-heat the oven at 200 degrees C (about 400 degrees F) C=Celsius or _centigradi_.
6.  In a bowl combine the zucchini, mix with the egg, grated cheese, minced chives. You can use your hands to mix everything. Optional: you can add roasted pine nuts.
7.  Add the plain bread crumbs: you want to add them to get a more solid consistency, but if you add too many bread crumbs the zucchini balls will be hard and less tasty.
8.  Make zucchini balls of about one inch in diameter.
9.  Optional: you can gently roll them in bread crumbs
10.  Take an oven tray and spread a thin coat of olive oil.
11.  _Cuocere in forno a_ 200 degrees C (circa 400 degrees F) for about 15 _minuti_.

*   _spezie_/spices
*   _olio d’oliva_/olive oil
*   _sale_/salt

### Preparazione/Directions
