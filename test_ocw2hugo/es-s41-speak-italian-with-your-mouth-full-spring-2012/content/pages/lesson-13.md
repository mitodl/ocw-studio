_{{< anchor "3" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Funghi Trifolati_/Sauteed Mushrooms With Garlic and Parsley
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ingredienti

*   Dried _porcini_ or your favorite fresh _funghi_/mushrooms
*   If you are making pasta for four people, use about 1 lb of fresh mushrooms or 0.2 lb of dry mushrooms
*   _Aglio_/garlic, as much or as little as you want
*   _Prezzemolo fresco_/fresh Italian parsley
*   _Panna da cucina_ (the closest ingredient I found in the U.S. is heavy cream), as much or as little as you want (you can use none)
*   _Olio extravergine d'oliva, sale, pepe_/pepper

### Procedimento

1.  If you use dry mushrooms, soak them in warm water for about one hour. If you use fresh mushrooms, wash them and cut them in medium/small pieces.
2.  Make a _soffritto_/sweat with garlic (whole cloves, easy to remove, or chopped) in olive oil.
3.  _Aggiungi_/add _i funghi e mescola_/and mix. If you use dry mushrooms, you can add part of the water in which you soaked them.
4.  When the mushrooms are cooked (it takes 5–10 minutes), lower the heat to low, add heavy cream, salt, pepper, and the parsley leaves (washed and finely chopped).
5.  Remove from the heat: _i funghi sono pronti_! Serve them mixed with your tagliatelle or as a side dish/_contorno_! If you want, top with your favorite grated cheese.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ingredienti per 4 persone

*   400 g = 0.9 lb, a little more than 3 cups _di farina/_of flour – all purpose
*   Four _uova grandi_/large eggs
*   _Un pizzico di_ sale/a pinch of salt
*   If needed to hold the dough together, _due cucchiai di acqua tiepida_/two spoonfuls of warm water

### Procedimento

1.  Place the flour on the counter or _in una ciotola_/a bowl, make a well in the center, put the eggs in the well, and mix with your fingers or _con l'aiuto_/with the help _di una forchetta_/of a fork.
2.  _Impasta_/knead thoroughly: the dough is very hard to knead, but you want it to become smooth.  
    If you prefer, you can use _un robot da cucina_/a food processor.
3.  Let the dough rest for about one hour (wrapped in plastic film). If you are impatient, you can skip this step.
4.  Flatten the dough using a pasta machine or a rolling pin. If you use a pasta machine, lightly dust it and the dough with flour each time you run the pasta through it. Start from the widest setting and switch to the narrower until you reach the desired thickness. If you use the rolling pin, be sure to dust it and the counter with flour; flatten down to a thickness on about half a mm. Essentially as thin as you can.
5.  Cut the pasta in your favorite shape. _Tagliatelle_ are about 5–7 mm (0.2/0.3") wide, _pappardelleare_ wider (1.5–2 cm)

### Commenti e variazioni

*   You can save the scrap pieces of irregular shape: they even have a name _maltagliati_/badly cut).
*   Cook your pasta in boiling salty water for 3–5 minutes.
*   If you made too much, freeze it before you cook it. In that case do not let it thaw before cooking it.
*   You can make pasta with less or _senza uova_/without eggs: in this case use only warm water.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **La Caprese**

_La caprese è un antipasto_ with fresh _mozzarella_, tomatoes, basil and good olive oil. This is a variation for a quick and easy summery pasta sauce.

### Ingredienti

*   _Pomodorini_/cherry tomatoes, o you can also use other kinds of tomatoes
*   _Mozzarella fresca_/fresh mozzarella, if you like it you can use _mozzarella di bufala_
*   _foglie di basilico fresco_/leaves of fresh basil
*   _olio extravergine di oliva_
*   _sale, pepe, peperoncino_
*   optional: _capperi_/capers. If you use capers in salt, rinse them well before use
*   optional: _percorino romano grattuggiato_/grated

If you do not like to cook a _occhio_/by eye, then for four people consider about 1 lb of _pomodorini_ and 1 large _mozzarella_ (7–8 oz).

### Procedimento

1.  _Lava e taglia_/wash and cut _i pomodorini_ in quarters.
2.  _Taglia la mozzarella a cubetti._
3.  _In una ciotola grande_/in a large bowl _mescola_/mix _i pomodorini, la mozzarella_, few (washed) leaves of basil (whole, or broken in pieces, using your hands), olive oil, salt, pepper, and red crushed pepper.
4.  If you like them, add a bunch of _capperi_ and _percorino romano_.
5.  Your pasta sauce is ready. You do not need to cook anything! When the pasta is cooked and drained, mix all together in the bowl or in the pot.

_Buon appetito_ =)

**_Orecchiette Fresche_**

_Le orecchiette sono un tipo di pasta originario della regione Puglia._

_Orecchietta_ literally means "little cute ear" (_orecchio_ or _orecchia_ \= ear).

### Ingredienti (per 4 persone)

*   400 g _di farina di grano duro_ (literally "flour of hard wheat"→durum flour, or sifted semolina flour – about 3 cups)
*   _Un pizzico di sale_
*   _Acqua tiepida_/warm water, as much as needed

### Procedimento

1.  _Impasta_/knead forcefully for at least 10 minutes. You want the dough to be hard, smooth, and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. If you do not have the patience/_la pazienza_ to wait it's ok. ;)
2.  Roll pieces of dough into ropes as thin as a pen, and with a knife cut pieces of about 1/4". With your hands, or with the help of a knife, give these pieces the characteristic _orecchietta_ shape.Watch our videos or check out this link for visual help [http://www.gennarino.org/orecchiette.htm](http://www.gennarino.org/orecchiette.htm).
3.  If you are not starving, let the _orecchiette_ dry for a few hours. You can skip this step.
4.  Cook your _orecchiette_ in boiling salty water for about 10 minutes or until _al dente_.
