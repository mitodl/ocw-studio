Let's refresh some _vocabolario_!

*   **_il bar_** _in Italia_ is not a place where they serve just alcoholic drinks, but it refers also to a coffee house. People drink coffee at the bar all the time, mostly standing at the counter (Italian coffee is so small that you do not need to sit or carry it with you to drink it).
*   _**caffè**_ really refers to _espresso_, and it is served in a _tazzina_ (_una tazza piccola_ = a small cup).
*   there is no small, medium, large: you either simply ask for _un caffè_ (regular size), _**or caffè doppio/caffè lungo**_ (double/long: it has a little more water) or **_caffè ristretto_** (literally "shrinked", more concentrated, with less water).
*   _**caffè macchiato caldo**_, "stained" with a tiny bit of warm frothed milk. _macchia_ \= spot, stain _macchiare_ \= to stain, _caldo_ = hot.
*   _**caffè macchiato freddo**_, served with a tiny bit of cold/_freddo_ milk on the side, in a small jug.
*   _**cappuccino**_, served in a cup, it needs no explanation, but if you order _cappuccino_ in the city of Trieste you may be disappointed, as they would serve you a miniature _cappuccino_, similar to a _macchiato caldo_. Trieste has its own coffee vocabulary that you may want to check before a trip.
*   _**marocchino**_ (Literally "from Morocco"): espresso, frothed milk, cocoa powder, served in _una tazzina._
*   _**caffè corretto**_ espresso "corrected" with a shot of liquor, typically _grappa_ or _Sambuca._
*   _**caffè d'orzo**_, espresso made from barley, it is decaf and the taste is different, worth trying. It can be ordered in all the variations, just like a normal _caffè_.
*   _**caffè decaffeinato**_ or _**caffè HAG**_ (from the name of a common brand).
*   _**d'estate**_ (_di estate_, during the summer) you can find **_caffè freddo._**
*   _**caffelatte**_ (or _caffè latte_) is the American latte. We make it mostly at home for _colazione_, it is very rare to hear anyone ordering un _caffelatte al bar._
*   _a casa_, everyone makes _caffè_ by using the italian coffee maker, called **_caffettiera_** (also called _moka_, or _Bialetti_, from the name of the original brand).
