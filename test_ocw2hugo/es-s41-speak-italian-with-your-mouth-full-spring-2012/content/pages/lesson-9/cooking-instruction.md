_Il Tiramisù_/Tiramisu
----------------------

_Tiramisù_ means _pick me up_ (_tira_ = 2nd person singular of the verb _tirare_, to pull or to throw — _mi_ = me — _su_, without accent = up). It is such a popular dessert that it needs no introduction =)

The opposite of _su_ is _giù_.

### Ingredienti

*   Six _uova_/eggs _a temperatura ambiente_ (Literally "at environment temperature", at room temperature)
*   750 g _mascarpone_ (about 26.5 ounces, at Shaw's you can find the brand Belgioioso)
*   8–10 _cucchiai di zucchero_/spoonfuls of sugar
*   A drop of marsala or rum or another liquor (if you are 21 or over)
*   2–3 packages of ladyfingers (_savoiardi_, you can find them in the Italian sector at any grocery store)
*   A tablet of dark chocolate (_cioccolato fondente_, altough _fondente_ does not mean dark, but melting) or cocoa powder/_cacao in polvere_
*   _caffè_ (coffee) as much as needed (1 or 2 cups are usually sufficient)

### Procedimento

1.  In a _ciotola_/bowl, _mescola_/mix the egg yolks (_i tuorli_ or _rossi d'uovo_ = literally "the reds of the egg") with the _mascarpone_ \[and the marsala\].
2.  In another _ciotola,_ whisk the whites/_monta gli albumi_ or _i bianchi_ with the sugar (you can whisk by hand with a fork or a hand whisk, or by using an electric beater).  
    Then mix the two creams gently: you want to avoid the egg whites foam to collapse.
3.  In the meantime, prepare your favorite coffee (I use espresso, I will write more about _caffè_ in the next days), let it cool down and put it in a shallow dish.
4.  Dip the ladyfingers in the coffee and make a layer on a rectangular pyrex/ceramic pan. Then add a layer of cream, then another layer of soaked ladyfingers.
5.  Make in total 2-3 layers of ladyfingers, end with a thin layer of cream and sprinkle with shaved dark chocolate (you can shave the chocolate with a cheese grater) or cocoa powder.
6.  Put in the fridge, if you have enough patience wait (_aspetta_, from aspettare) a few hours and enjoy. If you wait one day it tastes even better. Serve chilled!

Variations: if you prepare tiramisù for kids, you can substitute the _caffè_ with a mix of milk and decaf.
