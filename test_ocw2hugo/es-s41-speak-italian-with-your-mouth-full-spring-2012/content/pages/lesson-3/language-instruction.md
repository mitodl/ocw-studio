Come State?/How Are You?
------------------------

*   _Come state?_ (Literally "How do you stay?")/How are you?"
    *   _Spero bene!_ /I hope well!

You may be wondering whether am I talking to you as a single person, or to you as a group. In English you would know it from the context. In Italian you would know it from the structure of the sentence itself, because I would use a different form of the verb _stare_.

| ITALIAN | ENGLISH FORM OF "YOU" |
| --- | --- |
| _(voi) come state?_ | You-plural |
| _(tu) come stai?_ | You-singular |
| _(lei) come sta?_ | You-singular, formal (like Usted in Spanish) 

Here is how you can answer:

| ITALIAN | ENGLISH |
| --- | --- |
| _Bene._ Or _benissimo/molto bene_. | Very well. |
| _Non c'è male, grazie._ | Not bad, thank you. (Literally "There isn't bad.") |
| _Cosi cosi._ | So so. |
| _Male_ | Bad. |
| {{< td-colspan 2 >}}Note: If we are in a formal relationship, you should say _E Lei_? instead of _E tu_?{{< /td-colspan >}} |

_Essere O Stare? Questo è il Dilemma!_/Using the Verbs Essere or Stare? That is The Question!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   We ask _come stai_, not _come sei_.
*   As a general rule, _essere_ means "to be", and _stare_ means "to stay".
*   However, _stare_, not _essere_ is always used, when followed by the adverbs _bene, male, meglio, or peggio_ (worse). _Stare bene_ with an indirect pronoun (dative) means "it suits you".
*   _Questo vestito ti (=a te) sta bene_/This dress suits you. (Literally "this dress stays well to you").

_Stare_ followed by the gerundive expresses the continuous tenses:

| ITALIAN | ENGLISH |
| --- | --- |
| _Sto cucinando._ | (I) am cooking. |
| _Stavo leggendo._ | (I) was reading. 

_Essere_ is used in general to indicate more permanent aspects of people or things.

| ITALIAN | ENGLISH |
| --- | --- |
| _Sono Daria._ | I am Daria. |
| _Sono di New York._ | I am from New York. |
| _Mike è Americano._ | Mike is American. |
| _Mia mamma è bionda._ | My mom is blond. (Used with identity, origin, nationality, aspect, religion, etc.) 

Sometimes it's also for transitory conditions/emotions.

| ITALIAN | ENGLISH |
| --- | --- |
| _Giovanni è ammalato_. (not sta ammalato) | John is sick. |
| _Alice è innamorata._ | Alice is enamored (in love). |
| _Sei felice?_ | Are you happy? 

_Essere_ is also used as a _verbo ausiliare_ (auxiliary verb, or helper) in the passive form:

*   _La pizza è cotta nel forno_./The pizza is baked (literally "cooked") in the oven.

When talking about a location, _essere_ and _stare_ are mostly the same:

_Siamo in cucina or stiamo in cucina./_We are in the kitchen.

If you want to talk about something you enjoy doing, you use the verb _piacere_ followed by the infinitive:

_A Giorgio piace cucinare._/George likes cooking. (Literally "cooking is pleasing to George.")

As we started planning what to cook next, we made the list of what toppings we like on pizza.

| ITALIAN | ENGLISH |
| --- | --- |
| _Cosa ti (= a te) piace sulla pizza?_ | What do you like on your pizza? (Literally "What is pleasing to you on pizza?") |
| _Mi (=a me) piace la mozzarella._ | I like mozzarella. (Literally "Mozzarella is pleasing to me.") |
| _Mi piacciono le melanzane e i peperoni,_ | I like eggplant and peppers. (Literally "Eggplants and peppers are pleasing to me.")
