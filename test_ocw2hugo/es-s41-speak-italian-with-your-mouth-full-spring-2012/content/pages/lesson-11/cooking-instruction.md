_I Cantucci_/Biscotti
---------------------

_Ieri sera abbiamo preparato i cantucci or cantuccini._

*   There are two variations: _i cantucci di Siena_ (with butter, more crumbly) _e quelli di Prato (vicino a Firenze)_.
*   _I cantucci di Prato_ are also known as _biscotti di Prato_, or in the U.S. simply as _biscotti_.
*   _Biscotti_ means "cooked twice": _bis_ is the Latin prefix for twice (at the end of a concert we usually shout _bis_!!! instead of encore) and _cotti_ (cooked).
*   _I cantucci_ are indeed baked twice. However, _in_ _Italia usiamo_ the word _biscotti_ for any sorts of cookies, including those that bake only once, like chocolate chip cookies.
*   The recipe below is adapted from _una ricetta di mia zia Mariolina_.

### Ingredienti

(This amount is for a couple of baking sheets of _cantucci_):

*   680 g = 1 1/2 lb _di farina bianca_
*   1 _cucchiaio di lievito istantaneo_/baking powder
*   680 g = 1 1/2 lbs _di miele_/honey/  \[if you do not like honey, you can instead add 2 eggs **or** some melted butter **or** extra virgin olive oil **and** 100g, about 1/2 cup of sugar. You would only need a little butter or oil- just enough to keep to dough together.\]
*   4 _(quattro) uova_
*   100 g _di zucchero_
*   680 g = 1 1/2 lbs _di mandorle intere_/whole almonds, with skin
    \[you can substitute _le mandorle_ with chopped dark chocolate or _uvetta_, raisins or make a mix of the three. You may also try to use _nocciole_/hazelnuts\]
*   _la buccia grattuggiata di un'arancia_/grated zest of one orange—you can use lemon as well.
*   Optional: you can add some spices, such as vanilla, or fennel seeds, cinnamon, a little nutmeg ...

### Procedimento

1.  Preheat _il forno_ (oven) to 180 degrees C or 350 degrees F. Cover the baking sheet/_teglia_ with parchment paper/_carta da forno_.
2.  In a very large _ciotola_/bowl, place the flour mixed with the baking powder.
3.  Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the honey, using a spatula or your fingers/_le tue dita_ to gently mix as you pour.
4.  In a small _ciotola_, briefly mix the eggs and the sugar with a whisk. Add the orange zest.
5.  Again, make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour into it the egg andsugar mixture. _Mescola con le mani_/with your hands or with a rubber spatula for a few minutes.
6.  _Aggiungi_ the almonds and _mescola_ for a few more minutes. The dough will be soft, rough, and sticky.
7.  Take some of the dough in your hands and place it _sulla teglia_. Press the dough to form a log the length of the baking sheet, 1-1.5 cm (~1/2") thick and 5 cm (~2") wide. Ideally, you should try to shape it such that the center is a little bit thicker. Bake for 25 minutes or until lightly brown.
8.  Remove the logs from the baking sheets and place them on a cutting board. Cut each log in 0.5 cm (~1/4") pieces. If you want you can cut them on a slight diagonal.
9.  Place these pieces back on the baking sheets leaning one of the cut sections against the bottom of the sheet. Bake for approximately 10 more minutes per side.
10.  Remove from the oven. The _cantuccini_ will become harder when they cool down.

We usually eat them dipped in a glass of _Vin Santo_ (literally "holy wine", a sweet dessert wine) ... but you can dip them in milk

Note: once the _cantucci_ are cooled, you can place them in tin cans and keep them for a long time. You can also freeze them.
