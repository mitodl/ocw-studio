"""
These rules are intended to help fix data after the legacy shortocde incident.
Prior to https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-studio/pull/1013, "legacy" shortcodes
like {{< baseurl >}} would become corrupted in studio during editing. The editor:
    - displayed the shortcodes as raw text in studio edit
    - then escaped special characters like "[" and "<" when saving (only if edits were made)

This rule selectively unescapes content.

### Strategy
In general, there there are two data corruptions we're trying to fix. Consider
the texts

    blah \[Some Tile\]{{\< resource\_file uuid >}} blah
    blah blah {{\< sup 2 >}} blah

We will make two rules:
1. Fix the stuff BEFORE the shortcode, namely link/image title (line 1)
2. Fix the shortcode itself and its contents

The `\<` in the first line will be caught by the second rule.
