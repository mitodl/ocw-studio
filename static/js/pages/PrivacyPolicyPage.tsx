      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        OCW Studio is a tool for members of the MIT community to create courses
        and resources for the MIT OpenCourseWare site.
      </p>
      <h3>What personal information we collect</h3>
      <p>
        We collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal
        information about you, which we have grouped together as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Biographic information – name and email address, as provided by MIT’s
          Identity Provider, Touchstone
        </li>
        <li>IP addresses</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How we collect personal information about you</h3>
      <p>
        We collect information, including Personal Information, when you create
        an account and login. We also collect certain usage information as you
        create and edit courses. In addition, we track information indicating,
        among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in
        which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks
        and other user interface controls were used.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may log the IP address, operating system, and browser software used
        by each user of the Site, and we may be able to determine from an IP
        address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location
        of his or her point of connectivity. Various web analytics tools are
        used to collect this information. Some of the information is collected
        through cookies (small text files placed on your computer that store
        information about you, which can be accessed by the Site). You should be
        able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web
        browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to
        reject cookies in the 'Help' section of the toolbar. If you reject our
        cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Site may not work
        properly.
      </p>

      <h3>When we share your personal information:</h3>
      <p>
        We will share information we collect (including Personal Information)
        with third parties as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          With service providers or contractors that perform certain functions

        </li>
        <li>
          For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in the
          areas of cognitive science and education. However, we will only share
          Personal Information about you for this purpose to the extent doing so
          complies with applicable law and is limited to the Personal
          Information required to fulfill the purposes stated at the time of
          collection.
        </li>

          Terms of Service, our Honor Code, or this Privacy Policy; as otherwise
          may be required by applicable law; or to protect our rights, property,
          or safety or those of others.
        </li>

          controlled by us.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In cases where we share or disclose your Personal Information: (1) the
        third party recipients are required to handle the Personal Information
        in a confidential manner and to maintain adequate security to protect
        the information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure,
        alteration, and destruction; and (2) we will only disclose and share the
        Personal Information that is required by the third party to fulfill the
        purpose stated at the time of collection. In addition, we may share
        aggregated information that does not personally identify you with the
        public and with third parties, including but not limited to researchers
        and business partners.
      </p>
      <h3>How your information is stored and secured</h3>
      <p>
        MIT is dedicated to protecting Personal Information in its possession or
        control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security
        policies, processes, and procedures, including administrative, physical,
        and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Information
        that it receives, maintains, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of
        transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
        secure, and therefore we do not guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <h3>How long we keep your personal information</h3>
      <p>
        We consider our relationship with the MIT Micromasters community to be
        lifelong. This means that we will maintain a record for you until such
        time as you tell us that you no longer wish us to keep in touch. After
        such time, we will retain a core set of information for MIT
        Micromasters’s legitimate purposes, such as archival, scientific and
        historical research and for the defense of potential legal claims.
      </p>
      <h3>Rights for Individuals in the European Economic Area</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right in certain circumstances to (1) access your personal
        information; (2) to correct or erase information; (3) restrict
        processing; and (4) object to communications, direct marketing, or
        profiling. To the extent applicable, the EU’s General Data Protection
        Regulation provides further information about your rights. You also have
        the right to lodge complaints with your national or regional data
        protection authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are inclined to exercise these rights, we request an opportunity
        to discuss with you any concerns you may have. To protect the personal
        information we hold, we may also request further information to verify
        your identity when exercising these rights. Upon a request to erase
        information, we will maintain a core set of personal data to ensure we
        do not contact you inadvertently in the future, as well as any
        information necessary for MIT archival purposes. We may also need to
        retain some financial information for legal purposes, including US IRS
        compliance. In the event of an actual or threatened legal claim, we may
        retain your information for purposes of establishing, defending against
        or exercising our rights with respect to such claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        By providing information directly to MIT, you consent to the transfer of
        your personal information outside of the European Economic Area to the
        United States. You understand that the current laws and regulations of
        the United States may not provide the same level of protection as the
        data and privacy laws and regulations of the EEA.
